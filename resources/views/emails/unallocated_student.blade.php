    <title>Student Buddy Scheme Allocation</title>

<body>
<h2>Hi all,</h2>
<br/>
We would like to thank you for your interest in participating in the Student Buddy Scheme.
<br/>
Unfortunately however, due to the uneven number of juniors and seniors we have been unable to allocate you to a buddy. You are, however, welcome to apply again next year as a senior buddy.
<br/>
