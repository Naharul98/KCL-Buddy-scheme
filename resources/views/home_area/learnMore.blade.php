    <h1>About this scheme</h1>
    <p>The KCL buddy scheme allows new first year students to be given a mentor who is a more senior KCL student. We hope this will
      allow new students to learn from the expirience and have a more pleasent expirience when they are just starting out.</p>
    <p>To sign up to the scheme either as a buddy or a senior, simply create an account and complete each item on the checklist
      provided before the deadline</p>
